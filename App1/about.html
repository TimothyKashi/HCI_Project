          This is a web app for CS 420 by Tim Kashi,
          Jake Lahr, and Alexis Diaz. The main goals of
          this web application are to help people decide
          what game to play if they are having trouble
          deciding what to play or looking for a new
          game in a certain genre. The main objective
          is to have the site be very simple, fun,
          and easy to use.
