          Team 13 aims to develop a web application that will recommend video
          games to users that want some recommendations on what games to play.
          The video game recommendations will be determined by administering a
          questionnaire to the users or offering an option to quickly choose a
          completely random game. The questionnaire will contain questions about
          previously played video games, personal tastes in genres, specific
          consols/marketplaces. The application will output different
          recommendations based on the answers, and will be able to suggest
          other games if the user is not satisfied with their recommendation.
          Team 13â€™s mission is to provide users with video game recommendations
          and exceptional user experience through a well-developed GUI that is
          focused on speed of recommendation and ease of use.
